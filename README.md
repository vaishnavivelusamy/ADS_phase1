# Credit-Card-fraud-detection-system-using-Machine-Learning
Detect Fraudulent Credit Card transactions using different Machine Learning models and compare performances

In this notebook, I explore various Machine Learning models to detect fraudulent use of Credit cards. I compare each model performance and results. The best performance is achieved using SMOTE technique.

Please note that this approach can be transferred to other detection analysis in alternatrive domains. The feature extraction process remains similar and can be replicated on many other detection issues.

# Problem Statement
The problem is to develop a machinelearning-based system for real-time credit card fraud detection. The goal is to create a solution that can accurately identify  fraudulent transactions while minimizing false positives. This project involves data preprocessing, feature engineering, model selection, training, and evaluation to create a robust fraud detection systems

# Techniques used in the project
The project compares the results of different techniques :
- Machine learning techniques:
  - Random Forest
  - Decision Trees
- Deep Learning techniques:
  - Neural network using fully connected layers.
 
  - Performance of the neural network is compared for different optimization approaches:
- plain binary cross-entropy loss minimization
- minimization using weights to compensate for the class imbalance
- Under-sampling of the non-fraudulent class to match the fraudulent class
- Over-sampling of the fraudulent class to match the non-fraudulent one by implementing SMOTE technique. The SMOTE method allows to generate a new vector using 2 existing datapoints. For additional details on this approach, you can read this detailed post [SMOTE for Imbalanced Classification with Python]

Note about the difference between Random Forest and Decision tree models:
- A Random Forest is essentially a collection of Decision Trees. A decision tree is built on an entire dataset, using all the features/variables, whereas a random forest randomly selects observations (rows) and specific features/variables to build multiple decision trees from and then averages the results. After a large number of trees are built using this method, each tree "votes" or chooses the class, and the class receiving the most votes by a simple majority is the "winner" or predicted class.

  ###How users can get started with the project

  1. Problem Definition:
       Clearly define the problem you want to solve: real-time credit card fraud detection. Specify your goals, such as the accuracy rate and false positive rate you wantto achieve.
2. Data Collection:
       Obtain a labeled dataset of credit card transactions. This dataset should include both legitimate and fraudulent transactions.
3. Environment Setup:
       Set up your development environment, including Python, Jupyter Notebook, or any preferred IDE. Install necessary libraries, such as scikit-learn, pandas, numpy, and imbalanced-learn.
4. Data Exploration:
       Load your dataset and perform initial data exploration. Understand the data's structure, features, and their distributions. Check for class imbalance.
5. Data Preprocessing:
       Handle missing values, duplicates, and outliers. Encode categorical features if needed. Address class imbalance using techniques like oversampling (SMOTE) or undersampling.
6. Feature Engineering:
       Create new features or transform existing ones if it can help improve model performance. Feature selection to identify the most relevant features.
7. Model Selection:
       Choose a suitable machine learning model for fraud detection. Common choices include Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, and Support Vector Machines. Consider ensemble methods that combine multiple models for better results.
8. Data Splitting:
       Split your data into training and testing sets to evaluate the model's performance.
9. Model Training:
10.    Train your selected model on the training data.
11. Model Evaluation:
       Evaluate the model using appropriate metrics like precision, recall, F1-score, and accuracy.
Tune hyperparameters for better performance.
11. Real-time Integration:
        To achieve real-time detection, you'll need to integrate the trained model into a production environment. Set up a data pipeline to continuously feed new transactions to the model. Implement a monitoring system to track the model's performance over time. Set up alerting mechanisms for potential fraudulent activity.
12. Deployment and Monitoring:
       Deploy your system in a secure production environment. Continuously monitor the model's performance and retrain as needed to adapt to evolving fraud patterns.
13. Documentation:
       Document your project thoroughly, including the dataset used, preprocessing steps, feature engineering, model selection, and deployment procedures.
14. Compliance and Security:
       Ensure that your system complies with relevant data protection and privacy regulations. Implement security measures to protect sensitive credit card data.
15. Testing:
      Perform rigorous testing of your system to identify and address any issues.

 
     ##conclusion:
            
     In conclusion, the credit card fraud detection project has developed a robust system capable of identifying
     and mitigating fraudulent transactions. The model's performance, combined with rigorous data preprocessing, feature
     engineering, and a commitment to security and compliance, positions this project as a valuable asset in safeguarding
    financial transactions. It is imperative to maintain vigilance, adapt to emerging threats, and continue to advance the
    system's capabilities for a secure and resilient financial ecosystem.
